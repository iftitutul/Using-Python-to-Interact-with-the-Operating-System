## The Operating System

There are actually two main parts in operating system: 
- the kernel (System Resources, Disk, Memory, Network)
- the user space

So when we say operating system, we're referring to both the kernel and the user space.

### Kernel
The kernel is the main core of an operating system. It talks directly to our hardware and manages our systems resources.

### User Space
As users, we don't interact with the kernel directly. Instead, we interact with the other part of the operating system called the user space. The User space is basically everything outside of the kernel. These are things that we interact with directly, like the system programs and user interface.
