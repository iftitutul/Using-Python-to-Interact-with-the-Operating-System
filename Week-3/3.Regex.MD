A regular expression, also known as regex or regexp, is essentially a search query for text that's expressed by string pattern. When you run a search against a particular piece of text, anything that matches a regular expression pattern you specified, is returned as a result of the search. 

We can also use command line tools that know how to apply regexs, like **grep, sed, or awk**. We can even use regular expressions inside text processing tools like code or document editors.
